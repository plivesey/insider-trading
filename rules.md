# Stock Trading Board Game - Rules

## Overview
A strategic trading and market manipulation game for 3+ players where you bid on resources, trade with other players, and manipulate stock prices using hidden information to maximize your wealth.

## Components

### Cards
- **Resource Cards**: Four types (colors) - Blue, Orange, Yellow, Purple
  - Deck contains approximately 8-10 of each color (32-40 total cards)
  - These represent stocks that fluctuate in value
- **Goal Cards**: Each player receives 3 goal cards at the start
  - Kept private until revealed
  - Each goal card contains:
    - A stock movement instruction (e.g., "Blue +2" or "Orange-Purple -1")
    - A goal requirement (e.g., "Have 2 oranges, 1 blue, and 1 yellow")
    - A bonus reward for completing the goal

### Currency
- Coin tokens representing money
- Each player starts with $5
- All stocks start at a value of $4 each

## Setup

1. Shuffle the resource deck
2. Deal 3 random resource cards to each player (these are kept private/hidden)
3. Deal 3 goal cards to each player (these are kept private/hidden)
4. Give each player $5 in coins
5. Set all stock prices to $4 (use a shared tracker visible to all players)

## Game Structure

The game is played over **3 rounds**. Each round consists of 4 phases:

### Phase 1: Auction
- Reveal **n+1 cards** from the resource deck one at a time (where n = number of players)
- For each card revealed, conduct an open outcry auction:
  - Players call out bids freely with no set order
  - Highest bidder pays their bid to the bank and takes the card
  - The card is added to their public hand

### Phase 2: Trading
- **Duration**: 1-2 minutes (use a timer)
- **Rules**: 
  - Players may make any trades with any other players
  - Only current assets can be traded (resource cards and coins you currently have)
  - No promises or IOUs for future turns
  - All trades are binding and must be honored
  - Example trades: "I'll give you 1 blue and 2 coins for your yellow" or "I'll give you 3 coins for that orange"

### Phase 3: Goal Resolution

This phase happens in the following order:

1. **Reveal Goal Cards**: Each player simultaneously reveals one of their remaining hidden goal cards
2. **Adjust Stock Prices**: Apply all stock movements cumulatively
   - If three players reveal cards with "Blue +2", "Blue +1", and "Orange -1", then:
     - Blue increases by 3 (from $4 to $7)
     - Orange decreases by 1 (from $4 to $3)
3. **Complete Goals**: Each player checks if they have completed **their own revealed goal**
   - Check if you have the required resources shown on your revealed goal card
   - If yes, collect the bonus reward shown on that card
   - **Note**: You can ONLY claim bonuses from goal cards YOU reveal, not from other players' revealed cards
4. **Revealed Goal Cards**: Keep all revealed goal cards visible for the rest of the game (they show information but their bonuses cannot be claimed by other players)

### Phase 4: Sell
- Each player may sell any number of their resource cards back to the bank
- Players receive coins equal to the current stock price for each card sold
- Sold cards are removed from the game

## Goal Card Structure

Goal cards come in two difficulty levels:

### Easy Goals (1 coin equivalent bonuses)
- Simpler resource requirements
- Example bonuses:
  - Gain 1 coin
  - Peek at the top 2 cards of the resource deck

### Hard Goals (2 coin equivalent bonuses)
- More complex or rare resource combinations
- Example bonuses:
  - Gain 2 coins
  - Swap one of your resource cards for a random card from the deck
  - Adjust any one stock price by ±1

## End of Game

After **3 rounds** (all players will have revealed all 3 of their goal cards):

1. Calculate each player's final wealth:
   - Value of all resource cards at current stock prices
   - Plus all coins held
2. **Highest total value wins!**

## Strategy Tips

- Your goal cards give you advance knowledge of some stock movements
- Other players have different information on their goal cards
- Your resource cards are hidden, so you can bluff about what you have during trading
- Trading lets you position yourself for your goals while misleading others
- Timing when to play each goal card is crucial
- Selling at the right time can be more valuable than completing goals
- Having more cards gives you flexibility; having more money gives you buying power

## Notes

- Resource cards in your hand are kept hidden from other players
- Goal cards remain hidden until revealed during Goal Resolution
- Stock prices can go above or below their starting value of $4
- Once a goal card is revealed, it stays visible but only the player who revealed it could claim its bonus
